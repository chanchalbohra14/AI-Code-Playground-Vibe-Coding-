/*
  General App-wide styles can go here if needed,
  but most styles are in Layout.css, index.css, or component-specific CSS files.
  This file is kept minimal.

/* Example of a very global style you might want: */
/*
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 15px;
}
*/

/* Add any other global utility classes or very high-level app container styles here */
